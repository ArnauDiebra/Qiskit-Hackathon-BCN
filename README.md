## **About**

The Qiskit Hackathon Barcelona is an immersive competition featuring live engagement, teamwork, and mentorship by expert researchers, developers and advocates.

This event is being organized with the colaboration of: Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO), IBM Quantum, Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Moody's, Qiskit Community, Quantum Barcelona, Institut de FÃ­sica d'Altes Energies (IFAE), and hosted by Universitat AutÃ²noma de Barcelona (UAB).

The Qiskit Hackathon will take place from 1st to 2nd April in Escola d'Enginyeria UAB (Barcelona), Spain.

Participants will have 24 hours to work in teams to develop solutions to problems in the field of quantum computing and present it to a panel of judges.

Even though the hackathon will be done in teams of 6 people, there will be a team activity at the begining of the event.
So don't be afraid to come alone or without a complete team. Let's meet each other!

## **How to use this repository**

This repository contains the code you need to participate in the Hackathon. However, it is not meant to be used as a working environment. You should use your own environment to develop your code.

One of your team members should **fork** this repository and add the rest of the team as collaborators. This way, you will be able to work on the same code.

When the final code submission is ready, you should create a pull request to this repository, targeting the branch allocated for your team. This way, the judges will be able to review your code.
We expect you to submit your code **ONLY** at the end of the hackathon, and only once with a single pull request (although you can make as many commits as you want).
